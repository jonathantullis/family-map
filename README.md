# FamilyMap-Android

An android app that displays family tree data on an interactive Google Map.
Data can be generated randomly or loaded in manually in JSON format.

To get started, clone this repository and open up the project in Android Studio.

## Server

The server can be run locally in Android Studio simultaneously with the Android emulator.

1. Open the file located at ../server/src/main/java/Server.java and run the 'main' method.
  This can be done by clicking one of the green arrows to the left of the code.

2. Open up a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to verify the server is running. 
(When the server starts you will see the text "INFO: Listening on port 8080".
If a different port is indicated, navigate to that port in your browser instead
of 8080).

3. If you see the following screen, your server is running properly.
